              After a Cat Show at the Crystal Palace, I usually receive a number
              of letters requesting information. One asks: "What is a true
              tortoiseshell like?" Another: "What is a tabby?" and yet another:
              "What is a blue tabby?" One writes of the "splendid disposition"
              of his cat, another asks how to cure a cat scratching the
              furniture, and so on.
            </p>
            <p class="para-text">
              After much consideration, and also at the request of many, I have
              thought it best to publish my notes on cats, their ways, habits,
              instincts, peculiarities, usefulness, colours, markings, forms,
              and other qualities that are required as fitting subjects to
              exhibit at what is now one of the instituted exhibitions of "The
              land we live in," and also the Folk and other lore, both ancient
              and modern, respecting them.
            </p>
            <p class="para-text para-margin">
              That cats may be trained to respect the lives of other animals,
              and also birds on which they habitually feed, is a well-known
              fact.
            </p>
            <p class="para-text">
              Cats, properly trained, will not touch anything, alive or dead, on
              the premises to which they are attached. I have known them to
              sport with tame rabbits, to romp and jump in frolicsome mood this
              way, then that, which both seemed greatly to enjoy, yet they would
              bring home wild rabbits they had killed, and not touch my little
              chickens or ducklings.

              At the Brighton Show of 1886 there were two cats, both reared by
              dogs, the foster-mother and her bantling showing evident signs of
              sincere affection.
